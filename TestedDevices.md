# Supported Devices #

Every device that supports Java MIDP 2.0 and includes bluetooth connections (JSR-82) and file connections (JSR-75) extensions should be able to run Mobile Trail Explorer. But as we don't live in a perfect world there are big differences in Java implementations between devices. Also different GPS units acts differently.
