Mobile Trail Explorer is an application where user can view and record tracks using the mobile phone and GPS device. Recorded tracks can be exported in KML or GPX format. KML file can be viewed in Google Earth application. Mobile Trail Explorer is mainly targeted for recording biking, hiking etc. trails.

Software runs on Java platform so it is supported by many mobile phones. It is required that mobile phone supports Bluetooth connections (JSR 82) for GPS and File connection (JSR 75) for exporting trails to kml files.

Application can also render maps from [Open Street Map](http://www.openstreetmap.org). Maps can be downloaded over-the-air or preloaded to memory card. Other map providers can also be implemented easily in code.
